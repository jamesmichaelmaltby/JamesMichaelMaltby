During the last two years, I have led two major pieces of applied learning technology research which have helped me to become a specialist with blended learning and virtual reality. The first in 2017, entitled 'Practical Blended Learning', explored and evaluated the application of learning technology and blended learning pedagogy in vocational subjects. The second in 2018, entitled 'Teaching with Virtual Reality', explored best practices for designing and using immersive content within the classroom. Both projects were featured as case studies in JISC's FELTAG 2018 report ['Breaking through: stories of effective digital practice from UK further education (FE) and skills'](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6986/1/Breaking_through_stories_of_effective_digital_practice_report.pdf).

### Practical Blended Learning
Technology has become ubiquitous in the classroom and in the modern workplace, but how can further education colleges integrate technology and digital literacy effectively into their teaching programmes? In 2017, Plumpton College researched and evaluated new teaching practices as well as trialling the latest learning technologies in vocational subjects. As project lead I coordinated the activity of all teachers and wrote the final report. The project has led to increased staff digital literacy and usage of technology within their teaching. Students have benefited from new and enhanced learning opportunities as well as development of their digital skills. The research was funded by a grant from the Education & Training Foundations [Outstanding, Teaching, Learning & Assessment](https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/support-practitioners/improvements-in-teacher-learning-and-assessment/) programme. 

I presented the paper at [JISC Digifest 2018](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/digifest-06-mar-2018), Association of Colleges, Landex and the [Blended Learning Consortium](http://blc-fe.org/independencelearningday.html). Please download the full [project report](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk/practical-blended-learning-report.pdf) and view the [presentation](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk/practical-blended-learning-presentation.pdf) for more information. Many of the diagrams featured in this portfolio were developed for this report.

### Teaching with Virtual Reality
Entry-level immersive technology has reached a price and complexity-point where it is now accessible to the average classroom. But how can teachers effectively integrate these technologies into their lessons? In 2018, Plumpton College received further research funding from the Education & Training Foundation to explore the use of virtual reality in the classroom. As project lead I coordinated a partnership of further education colleges – including Sussex Downs, Greater Brighton Metropolitan and Myerscough College – to produce a series of case studies of using different types of immersive technology in various teaching activities. I was also responsible for project manage content creation and writing the final research report. 

Staff and students were directly involved in the production and evaluation of immersive content at each college. The project evaluated the impact that different technologies had on various teaching and learning activities, including orientation tasks, knowledge retrieval and skills acquisition. We found the most positive evaluations from students and teachers came from using 360° photography and video to immerse students in both new and familiar learning situations. Although skills acquisition tasks were suited to full-room virtual reality technology with interactivity, they proved to be the least accessible activities for the average classroom. The technology that had the greatest net impact on teaching & learning was all-in-one mobile virtual reality combined with prepared 360° video. 

The partnership published the website [Teaching with Virtual Reality](https://www.teachingwithvirtualreality.com) to showcase the case studies and the final project report. The following trailer was produced for Plumpton College's case studies:

I presented the paper at the [Swansea University Virtual Reality in Higher Education](http://www.swansea.ac.uk/vr-in-teaching/vr-conference/) conference in September 2018. The project received commendation from the [Association of College's Beacon Awards](https://www.aoc.co.uk/aoc-beacon-awards-stage-1-beacon-standard?dm_i=26BG,5VI93,L0BA5D,MZ4AU,1) for 'Effective use of technology in Further Education'.
