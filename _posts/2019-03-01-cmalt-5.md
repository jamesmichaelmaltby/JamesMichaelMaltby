Two major pieces of legislation that has affect my working practice in the last year is the introduction of the [General Data Protection Regulations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation) (GDPR) in May and update to [Keeping Children Safe in Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2) (KCSIE) in September. Both presented different professional challenges.

The GDPR introduces new obligations on data processors, including the requirements to justify the use of specific personal data, get informed consent, and create processes for changes or removal of data. As learning technology manager I am responsible for our virtual learning environment platform which contains personal and learning data for all staff and students. To ensure compliance, I project managed the update of the [Moodle platform to version 3.3](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/GDPR). It was not ideal to make such a major update to the platform during term-time but my team staggered the update over a month to give us enough time to test all sub-systems before releasing it to the students in April 2018. As well as updating the core platform, we introduced a new form to collect data requests:

</a>

The majority of data requests have been for changes to names, emails or access to learning data from archived courses. 

KCSIE was updated in September 2018. It outlines the legal duties that all staff must follow to safeguard and promote the welfare of students at college. I was asked by senior management to ensure our new staff online safeguarding course was updated and to find a way to encourage all staff to read the updated regulations. The second aspect of this request was the hardest because it is difficult to force staff who have previously completed an online course to review their learning. Our solution was to develop a new on-boarding exercise for staff on the virtual learning environment:

</a>

This pop-up learning task had to completed before staff could continue to the rest of the site. Compliance was monitored and reported back to the safeguarding team. 

> On reflection, I believe the most important reason for being aware of wider issues in technology is being able to properly advise and support non-specialist staff. Most teachers do not have the time to keep up-to-date with the latest practice and regulations. As a specialist, a learning technologist can disseminate this information appropriately and support organisation wide changes.
