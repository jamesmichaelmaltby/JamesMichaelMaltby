Since January 2018, I have been the learning technology manager at [Plumpton College](https://www.plumpton.ac.uk) near Lewes in England. The college is a provider of further and higher education specialist land-based courses. My role consists of three main aspects. Firstly, I am responsible for the project management of learning technology projects and innovation research at the college. Secondly, I am responsible for the digital skill development of staff and students, including providing training on the use of specific learning technologies. Finally, I am responsible for online learning design and development of the colleges virtual learning environment.

From December 2016 to January 2018, I was initially employed at Plumpton College as the virtual learning environment developer. My role during this period was to develop their Moodle platform branded [Plumpton Online](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk) and to train staff on the new system.

Before working full-time in learning technology, I was a special educational needs teacher at [Broomhill Bank School](http://www.broomhillbank.org.uk) in Rusthall. The school is a provider for students with communication and interaction difficulties and specific speech and language impairments, including those on the autistic spectrum. Whilst at the school I coordinated various technology projects including the deployment of tablet computers in classrooms and the use of a new virtual learning environment.

For the last two years I have managing learning technology as the sole aspect of my job. I have been developing the experience and capabilities required of someone within my specialist role. I feel I am at the right moment in my career to apply for professional accreditation.
