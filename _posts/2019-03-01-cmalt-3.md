I believe I meet the requirements of operational competence due to my strong understanding of the constraints and benefits of technologies, ability to showcase best practice and support the strategic deployment of technology across a whole organisation.

### Understanding the Constraints and Benefits of Different Technologies
When I first started working at Plumpton College, one of my first tasks was to work with staff to evaluate the learning technology that was currently being used in lessons or had the potential for use in the future. This was part of the college's wider blended learning research discussed below in [Specialist Options](/cmalt#specialistoptions). We identified the following ten technologies:

These formed the basis of a period of evaluation in lessons in order to identify the current constraints and benefits. I compiled the following chart to summarise the feedback we received from staff and students:

</a>

The two most important lessons we learnt from these evaluations was the impact that digital skills and technical confidence had on the effectiveness of technology, and how the technology infrastructure of the college was the biggest barrier to the use of new technology in the classroom.  

### Technical Knowledge and Ability in the use of Learning Technology
To start to overcome the issue of digital skills and technical confidence that were identified above, I was asked to design a curriculum of twilight workshops. These sessions were designed as an opportunity to showcase best practices and provide practical training to staff. We branded this programme 'Blended Learning Month':

Over 80 members of staff attended at least one twilight session during November 2017. Running the sessions proved a valuable means for me to fully develop my knowledge and ability with the technology and to develop effective best practices to pass onto staff. However, I had to be aware that the majority of teachers would not have the dedicated time that I had to specialise in all areas so, I would have to highly targeted in my training.

### Supporting the Deployment of Learning Technologies
To avoid barriers to the use of learning technology due to infrastructural issues, it was decided that the college's IT strategy needed to be renewed for the new academic year. In January 2018 I worked closed with the Head of Teaching, Learning and Quality and the IT Manager to create the college's new [Digital Learning Strategy](/files/digitallearningstrategy.pdf). This document formalised our new digital skills programme discussed below and outlined a roadmap for the further development and deployment of technologies. 

To write this report, I had to meet with every division in the college and student representatives from the union. This proved a valuable exercise in evaluating our operational objectives to create a strategic plan that was suitable for all members of the college.

> In reflection it was incredibly important to canvas as diverse a set of users as possible to write a document that was practical and feasible. So far the process of change across the college has been successful with many new IT systems being introduced in the new academic year and a noticeable increase in the digital skills and confidence of staff.
