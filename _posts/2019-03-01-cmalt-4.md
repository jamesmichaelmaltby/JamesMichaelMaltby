My role at Plumpton College is based within the Teaching & Learning Office separate from the IT department. The majority of my time is spent working directly with staff and students to help facilitate outstanding teaching, learning, and assessment. There are two main examples where I can demonstrate my direct involvement in teaching, learning and assessment in the last year. Firstly, I have developed my understanding of digital pedagogy to help support our teachers. Secondly, I have worked closely with the teacher training and quality team to design a structure for learning technology CPD and informal lessons observation.

### Understanding of Teaching, Learning and Assessment
One of the main parts of my learning technology role is to help staff to scaffold technology within their teaching. As part of my further research into digital pedagogy, I adapted the work of [Blended Learning Universe](https://www.blendedlearning.org/models/) for our college. Five models of teaching were chosen which form a spectrum of ways that technology can be mixed with a teaching programme. The spectrum ranges from completely classroom based practice through to purely distance-learning. Different models may be used within the same session or different lessons within the same programme.

The first model is ‘Lab’. This is the most classroom centric and teacher led model. In a ‘Lab’ based lesson every student will use the same form of technology for the same activity. Examples of this could range from a teacher presenting a PowerPoint or students completing a computer based task in an IT Suite. 

In the second model, known as ‘Stations’, different technology is used to differentiate activities within the same classroom. Students are either directed to complete a particular activity by the teacher or have the choice of which task they would like to complete.

Thirdly, in a ‘Flipped’ classroom model, learning materials are made available to students remotely before a lesson. For example, this could include a presentation, video or initial assessment activity. Classroom time is then used for specific interventions.

Developing ‘Flipped’ further, the fourth model is ‘Flexible’. The majority of resources are online and students have a choice whether to attend particular classroom sessions for face-to-face teaching. This could be used for revision sessions, tutorials or optional learning activities. 

Finally, the fifth model is ‘Virtual’. In this model a lesson is taught through the use of a virtual learning environment or another form of remote technology. This is the most distance-learning based model.

### Understanding of Your Target Learners
While evaluating the use of technology across the college, one of the most common feedback we received from teachers was their lack of confidence to try out new ideas.

In order to help encourage a more experimental culture, I introduced a new structure for learning technology CPD and informal lessons observations based on the [3E framework developed at Edinburgh Napier University](https://staff.napier.ac.uk/services/vice-principal-academic/academic/TEL/TechBenchmark/Pages/overview.aspx). Each stage in the framework represents a development step for teachers starting to use a new technology. The first stage, ‘Embrace’, encourages teachers to use a new technology in their teaching without being concerned whether the resource has an immediate impact on learning. The second stage, ‘Enhance’, is when the technology has an impact on students by either improving an activity or creating new opportunities for learning. The final stage, ‘Empower’, is when a teacher feels confident enough to support students using a technology for independent learning activities or to help them develop digital skills.

Alongside this framework, I am currently in the process of launching a new formal digital skills programme for staff and students. The curriculum for this course has been based on feedback from everyone over the last year since we ran the blended learning month and other learning technology training sessions. Below is a screenshot of the current online course.

The Blended Learning Models, Three E's and Digital Skills are embedded within our Level 3 and 4 Teacher Training programmes. I have run specialist sessions to encourage our new teachers to experiment with new technologies and there is an expectation that they embrace a fresh idea within their assessed micro-teaches.

> In reflection, I believe it is incredibly important for learning technologists to become embedded within college teaching & learning processes. Unlike traditional IT roles, a learning technologists needs to be aware of the way that new products and services can directly impact on learning. The projects I have completed over the last two years would not have been successful without a clear understanding of teaching, learning and assessment. I also benefitted hugely from working closely with colleagues with teacher training specialism.
