During my time as a learning technologist, my greatest communication successes have been during the redevelopment of the Plumpton College virtual learning environment known as [Plumpton Online](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk) for the 2017/18 academic year. 

These two screenshots show a before and after shot of the redesign:

The following graph demonstrates the affect that this redevelopment had on monthly activity. There was a nearly 60% increase on peak activity between 2017 and 2018:

There were three main ways that communication lead to this success. Firstly, it was important for us to gather as much user feedback from staff and students before starting to design the new platform. I facilitated this through running workshops with every division within the college, senior management, governors committee and student union. A staff and student member of each division agreed to become testers of the new platform and provided regularly feedback through email. The main problem users reported with the old platform was the difficulty of finding information. Ease of use and accessibility therefore became our main goal for the redesign. 

Secondly, we formed a technical team of staff who were going to implement the redesign. This included a designer, developer, copywriter, and page designers for cross-college courses. I supervised the team and pulled all of the different content together. We used project management software to manage the different tasks that needed to be completed and to track progress.

Finally, when the new platform was ready to be released widely, we designed a structured training programme to introduce staff to the new system. I also ran workshops for students to communicate all of the changes so they were prepared for the new academic year. 

> I believe the most important role of a learning technologist is to empower staff and students. Communication is essential to achieving this as you need to understand the exact needs of the user and provide clear instruction. This also applies to an organisation as a whole. Before starting any change project it is important to listen to group needs and clearly articulate the impact of new processes and systems.
