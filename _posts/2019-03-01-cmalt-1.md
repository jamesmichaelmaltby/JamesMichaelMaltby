Welcome to my portfolio page for [Certified Membership](https://www.alt.ac.uk/certified-membership) (CMALT) of the [Association for Learning Technology](https://www.alt.ac.uk) (ALT). CMALT is a peer assessed accreditation for learning technology practitioners wishing to certify their experiences and capabilities, as well as demonstrate their commitment to professional development. ALT defines 'learning technology' as:

> The broad range of communication, information and related technologies that can be used to support learning, teaching, and assessment.
>
> – Association for Learning Technology, ['CMALT Guidelines'](https://www.alt.ac.uk/sites/alt.ac.uk/files/CMALT%20Guidelines_2018_NC_ND.pdf)

The principles and values of the CMALT scheme are: 
> * A commitment to exploring and understanding the interplay between technology and learning.
> * A commitment to keep up to date with new technologies.
> * An empathy with and willingness to learn from colleagues from different backgrounds and specialist options.
> * A commitment to communicate and disseminate effective practice.
