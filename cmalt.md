# My CMALT Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio page for [Certified Membership](https://www.alt.ac.uk/certified-membership) (CMALT) of the [Assocication for Learning Technology](https://www.alt.ac.uk) (ALT). CMALT is a peer assessed accredidation for learning technology practitioners wishing to certify their experiences and capabilities, as well as demonstrate their commitment to professional development. ALT defines 'learning technology' as:

> The broad range of communication, information and related technologies that can be used to support learning, teaching, and assessment.

The principles and values of the CMALT scheme are: 
* A commitment to exploring and understanding the interplay between technology and learning.
* A commitment to keep up to date with new technologies.
* An empathy with and willingness to learn from colleagues from different backgrounds and specialist options.
* A commitment to communicate and disseminate effective practice.


## Contextual Statement

Since January 2018, I have been the learning technology manager at [Plumpton College](https://www.plumpton.ac.uk) near Lewes in England. The college is a provider of further and higher education specialist land-based courses. My role consists of three main aspects. Firstly, I am responsible for the project management of learning technology projects and innovation research at the college. Secondly, I am responsible for the digital skill development of staff and students, including providing training on the use of specific learning technologies. Finally, I am responsible for online learning designer and development of the colleges virtual learning environment.

From December 2016 to January 2018, I was initially contracted at Plumpton College as the virtual learning environment developer. My role during this period was to develop their _Moodle_ platform branded [Plumpton Online](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk) and train staff on the new system.

Before working full-time in learning technology, I was a special educational needs teacher at [Broomhill Bank School](http://www.broomhillbank.org.uk) in Rusthall. The school is a provider for students with communication and interaction difficulties and specific speech and language impairments, including those on the autistic spectrum. Whilst at the school I coordinated various technology projects including the deployment of tablet computers in classrooms and the use of a new virtual learning environment.

For the last two years I have managing learning technology as the sole aspect of my job. I have been developing the experience and capabilities required of someone within my specialist role. I feel I am the right moment in my career to apple for professional accredidation.

## Core Area 1: Operational Issues
I believe I meet the requirements of operational competence due to my strong understanding of the constraints and benefits of technologies, ability to showcase best practices, and support the strategic deployment of technology across a whole organisation.

### Understanding the Constraints and Benefits of Different Technologies
When I first started working at Plumpton College, one of my first tasks was to work with staff to evaluated the learning technology that was currently being used in lessons or had the potential for use in the future. This was part of the college's wider Practial Blended Learning research project discussed below in [Specialist Options](/cmalt#specialistoptions). We identified the following ten technologies:

![Learning Technologies](/images/learningtechnologies.png#poster "Learning Technologies")

These formed the basis of a period of evaluation in lessons in order to identify the current constraints and benefits. I compiled the following chart to summarise the feedback we received from staff and students:

![Learning Technologies Evalulation](/images/learningtechnologiesevaluation.png#poster "Learning Technologies Evalulation")

The two most important lessons we learnt from these evaluations was the importance that digital skills and technical confidence had on the effectiveness of technology, and how the technology infrastructre of the college was the biggest barrier to the use of new technology in the classroom.  

### Technical Knowledge and Ability in the use of Learning Technology
In order to start to overcome the issues digital skills and technical confidence that were identified above, I was asked to design a programme of twillight workshops. These sessions were designed as an opporunity to showcase best practices and provide practical training to staff. We branded this programme 'Blended Learning Month':

![Blended Learning Month](/images/blendedlearning.png#poster "Blended Learning Month")

Over 100 member of staff attended at least one twillight session during November 2017.


### Supporting the Deployment of Learning Technologies
In order to avoid barriers to the use of learning technology due to infrastructural issues, it was decided that the college's IT strategy needed to be renewed for the new academic year. In January 2018 I worked closed with the Head of Teaching, Learning and Quality and IT Manager to create the college's new [Digital Learning Strategy](/files/digitallearningstrategy.pdf).

## Core Area 3: The Wider Context
Two major pieces of legislation that has affect my working practice in the last year is the introduction of the [General Data Protection Regulations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation) (GDPR) in May and update to [Keeping Children Safe in Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2) (KCSIE) in September. Both presented different professional challenges.

The GRPR introduces new obligations on data processors, including the requirements to jusitify the use of specific personal data, get informed consent, and create processes for changes or removal of data. As learning technology manager I am responsible for our virtual learning environment platform which contains personal and learning data for all staff and students. In order to ensure compliance, I project managed the update of the [Moodle platform to version 3.3](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/GDPR). It was not ideal to make such a major update to the platform during term-time but my team staggered the update over a month to give us enough time to test all sub-systems before releasing it to the students in April 2018. As well as updating the core platform, we introduced a new form to collect data requests:

![GDPR Form](/images/gdpr.png "GDPR Form")

The majority of data requests have been for changes to names, emails or access to learning data from archived courses. 

KCSIE was updated in September 2018. It outlines the legal duties that all staff must follow to safeguard and promote the welfare of students at college. I was asked by senior management to ensure our new staff online safeguarding course was updated and to find a way to encourage all staff to read the updated regulations. The second aspect of this request was the hardest because it is difficult to force staff who have previously completed an online course to review their learning. Our solution was to develop a new on-boarding exercise for staff on the virtual learning environment:

![KCSIE Popup](/images/kcsie.png "KCSIE Popup")

This pop-up learning task had to completed before staff could continue to the rest of the site. Compliance was monitored and reported back to the safeguarding team. 


## Core Area 4: Communication and Working with Others

### Practical Blended Learning
Technology has become ubiquitous in the classroom and in the modern workplace, but how can further education colleges integrate technology and digital literacy effectively into their teaching programmes? In 2017, Plumpton College researched and evaluated new teaching practices as well as trialling the latest learning technologies in vocational subjects. The research was based on the use of ‘Blended Learning’. The term describes the ways that teaching programmes can mix traditional classroom learning techniques with digital technologies. The project has led to increased staff digital literacy and usage of technology within their teaching. Students have benefited from new and enhanced learning opportunities as well as development of their digital skills. The research was funded by a grant from the Education & Training Foundations Outstanding, Teaching, Learning & Assessment programme. It has been presented at JISC Digifest, Association of Colleges, Landex and the Blended Learning Consortium. Please download the [report](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk/practical-blended-learning-report.pdf) and view the [presentation](https://www.plumptononline.ac.uk/practical-blended-learning-presentation.pdf) for more information.

### Teaching with Virtual Reality
Entry-level immersive technology has reached a price and complexity point where it is now accessible to the average classroom. But how can teachers effectively integrate these technologies into their lessons? In 2018, Plumpton College received research funding from the Education & Training Foundation to explore the use of virtual reality in the classroom. The college is leading a partnership of further education colleges – including Sussex Downs, Greater Brighton Metropolitan and Myerscough College – to produce a series of case studies of using different types of immersive technology in various teaching activities.

## Future Plans
In the next year I wish to continue to develop my experience and capabilities in formal adacdemic educational research. For example, this might include attending courses on the collection of qualitative and quantitative data in educational projects. In the future my hope is to begin a MPhil/PhD in Education to further explore the impact of immersive technology on learning.
