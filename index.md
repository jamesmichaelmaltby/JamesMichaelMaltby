I am an award-winning learning technologist and educational researcher specialising in blended and immersive learning design. My work embedding virtual reality within technical teaching was featured on BBC Countryfile. 

As well as working as a digital learning specialist within further and higher education, I have worked with small businesses through to multinational clients, including British Airways, National Trust and Tesco.

In 2019, I was awarded a awarded a fellowship from the 1851 Royal Commission and the Education & Training Foundation to continue my research into how immersive technology is transforming technical training. 

Before specialising in learning technology, I was a special educational needs teacher supporting students on the autistic spectrum.

Thank you for visiting my website.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Decade!
